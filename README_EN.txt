2. Capture an empty cell, placing a point
Points are "Live cells". Without them, you lose. They can be captured by the enemy (1)
Bases are your cells until the end of the game.

You can only capture adjacent cells (points).
The winner is the one who creates a point that the enemy cannot eat (bedrock)
